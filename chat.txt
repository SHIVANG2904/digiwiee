Default Export: Easier to import and often used when a module exports a single component.
Named Export: Useful when a module exports multiple components or functions, allowing you to import only what you need.
Choosing Between Them
Use default export if your module only exports one main component or function.
Use named export if your module exports multiple components or functions, providing more flexibility in what can be imported.
